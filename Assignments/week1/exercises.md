#### 1. Basic Q# Program (Random Bit Generator): Write a Q# operation that generates a random bit using a qubit in superposition and measures it.

#### 2. Entanglement with CNOT: Create a Q# operation that entangles two qubits using a CNOT gate and measures them.

#### 3. Multi-Qubit Random Number Generator: Write a Q# operation that generates a random 3-bit number (0 to 7) using 3 qubits.

#### 4. Bell State Verification: Create a Q# operation that prepares a Bell state (|00⟩ + |11⟩) and checks if the two qubits are always in the same state upon measurement.

#### 5. Superposition with Phase Flip: Write a Q# operation that puts a qubit in superposition and then applies a phase flip (Z gate) before measuring. Compare the results with and without the Z gate.

Question: Does the Z gate affect the measurement outcome in the computational basis?

#### 6. Controlled SWAP (Fredkin Gate): Implement a controlled-SWAP (Fredkin gate) in Q# where a control qubit determines whether two target qubits are swapped.

#### 7. Entanglement Across Multiple Qubits: Create a GHZ state (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state) for 3 qubits : |GHZ⟩ = (|000⟩ + |111⟩) / √2 . Measure all three qubits and verify that they are either all 0 or all 1.

#### 8. Quantum Teleportation (Optional Challenge): Implement the quantum teleportation protocol in Q#, where the state of one qubit is teleported to another using entanglement and classical communication.
