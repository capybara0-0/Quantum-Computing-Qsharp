The state of a qubit can be written as:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle
$$

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex amplitudes.

### Probabilities

- Probability of state $|0\rangle$: $|\alpha|^2$
- Probability of state $|1\rangle$: $|\beta|^2$

#### Question 1

Given a qubit with probability amplitudes $\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\beta = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, calculate the probabilities of finding the qubit in states 0 and 1.

#### Question 2

For a qubit with amplitudes $\alpha = 2 + i$ and $\beta = 1 - i$, determine the probabilities of measuring the qubit in states 0 and 1. Also, check if the amplitudes are normalized.

#### Question 3

A qubit is described by the amplitudes $\alpha = \sqrt{0.8}$ and $\beta = \sqrt{0.2}$. What are the probabilities of observing the qubit in states 0 and 1?

#### Question 4

If a qubit has amplitudes $\alpha = 3$ and $\beta = 4$, what are the probabilities of finding the qubit in states 0 and 1? Note that these amplitudes are not normalized.

#### Question 5

Given a qubit with complex amplitudes $\alpha = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $\beta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}$, calculate the probabilities of observing the qubit in states 0 and 1.
